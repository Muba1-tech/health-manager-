## 🧠 AI Engine

The AI risk scoring formula (in `js/ai-engine.js`):

```
urgencyScore = (symptomSeverity × 0.40)
             + (symptomDuration × 0.25)
             + (patientAge      × 0.15)
             + (chronicHistory  × 0.20)

Score  0–39  → NORMAL    (Green)  → Routine appointment
Score 40–69  → MODERATE  (Yellow) → Doctor within 24h
Score 70–84  → URGENT    (Orange) → Doctor within 2h
Score 85–100 → EMERGENCY (Red)    → Full-screen alert + 108
```

Doctor ranking formula:
```
rank = (availability × 30) + (1/distance × 25)
     + (1/waitTime   × 25) + (rating     × 20)
     + symptomMatch + ageBoost + specialtyBoost
```
